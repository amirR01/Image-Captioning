# Image-Captioning-Project
**Image Captioning using Recurrent Neural Networks**

- In this project we use deep neural network models to caption Flickr images.
- the dataset has 8091 images and each image in this dataset has an ID and there are 5 caption for each image .
- we used pretrained bert model to get the embedings and an LSTM layer for generating.
